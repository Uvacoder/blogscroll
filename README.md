![Blog deployment](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/workflows/Blog%20deployment/badge.svg)

An open directory of personal sites and blogs, maintained entirely on GitHub.

## üèó What is this?

This project was created by [Den Delimarsky](https://den.dev/) in an effort to bring attention to little digital gardens people maintain outside, well - walled gardens. In the past year, I found that I really enjoy reading people's personal stories, and discovering their own corners of the Internet. However, as it turns out there is no one place that I can visit to see what people are building, so I decided to whip this page up myself.

This is a nice replacement for the bookmarks I have in my browser, all aggregated into the **People** folder in the bookmarks bar.

And it goes without saying that this site is work in progress - your feedback is [very much welcome](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues)!

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How did you come up with the initial list of sites?

I actually just moved my bookmarks to the web. That's it - that's the complicated logic I used to compile the initial list.

### Can I add any site?

Not quite. I am very intentional about this project being a directory of sites that people manage **within their own domains**. The goal is to create an environment for serendipitous discovery of digital gardens that are outside the typical social media/newsletter aggregation sites. Which means that pull requests with links to Blogger, LiveJournal, Medium, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. will not be accepted.

Now, if you have a site that you host on Medium (or any other blog hosting service for that matter) and it has a custom domain associated with it - fantastic! Put it on the list.

Additionally, you need to ensure that the site does not contain inappropriate, harmful, abusive, or hateful content. Any sites that are found to be in violation of this rule will be removed without notice.

### Can I remove my site from the list?

Absolutely. [Open an issue](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues), [create a pull request](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/pulls), or ping me directly [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/denniscode).

### Can I remove someone else's site?

Not really. Short of that site being no longer available, or hosting abusive, harmful, or inappropriate content, you can only remove the site that you manage or previously added.

### A site is no longer active/returns a 404. Can it be removed?

Totally. [Open an issue](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues), [create a pull request](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/pulls), or ping me directly [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/denniscode) - I'll help fix the issue.

### A site seems to be hosting questionable content. What should I do?

You're probably sick of hearing this, but [open an issue](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues), [create a pull request](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/pulls), or ping me directly [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/denniscode) - I'll help fix the issue.

### I don't like the categories that are laid out. Can I change them?

The categories are by no means final, so if you have a suggestion on how to make those better, [open an issue](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues) first. **Do not submit a pull request** until you have an issue open, and it was agreed that the category makes sense.

### Can I put my blog into more than one category?

No. I am trying to keep the list fairly clean and simple, so your site can only be included in one category.

### Can I link to my social media instead?

No. Just personal sites, please.

### Can I include a link to my company/startup/business/consulting/project site?

Same as above - just personal sites, please.

### I want to create a pull request and add my site. What do I do?

Fork the repository, then add a new TOML entry for your site in the [`categories`](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/tree/main/web/data/categories) folder, in the respective `list.toml` file.

Basically, you need three data points - the URL, name of the person who the site belongs to, and a link to the favicon. The identifier for the site (in square brackets) should be the blog apex domain, with spaces and dashes removed.
